            <li>Can we place order online and what are payment options?</li>
            <p>Of course, you can place orders online. Upon confirmation of your payment, we will dispatch your order as soon as possible. Total time is based on the amount of time it takes<br>
             to get payment authorization, order processing, and the transit time from the carrier. This can range from 24 hours to 10 days for in-stock items. To avoid delays, please<br>
             ensure that you have provided us with the correct Shipping address.</p>
             <li>Is cash on delivery option available?</li>
             <p>Yes Cash On Delivery is available for Karachi only.</p>
             <li>Do the prices of On Order Products Change?</li>
             <p>We do everything to ensure that the prices on our website are correct and try to keep prices constant. Sometimes we need to change the prices, either up or down without any<br>
             prior notice due to change in Forex rates/government policies. Computer Zone reserves the right to change the prices on the website at any time without prior notice. In that<br>
             case, if you have ordered the product but not yet confirmed or you have even paid for a product the prices would not be valid. It's better to confirm the price's of On Order<br>
             Product's through phone call first and then deposit the amount after confirmation.</p>

            <li>Why do I write reviews?</li>
            <p>
             We want to hear your opinions. We want consumers to get the information they need to make smart buying choices. As a Czone client, you can submit reviews for items listed<br>
             on czone.com.pk. We encourage you to share your ideas, both favourable and unfavourable.
            </p>
            <li>What are the Tips on writing a great review?</li>
            <p>
             <b>Include the "why":</b> The best reviews include not only whether you liked or disliked a product, but also why. Feel free to talk about related products and how this item<br>
             compares to them.<br> 
             <b>Be specific:</b> Your review should focus on specific features of the product and your experience with it.<br>
             <b>Not too short, not too long:</b> The ideal length is 75 to 500 words.<br>
             <b>Be sincere:</b> We welcome your honest opinion about the product--positive or negative. We do not remove reviews because they are critical. We believe all helpful<br> information can inform our customers’ buying decisions. 
            </p>
            <li>What's not allowed?</li>
            <p>
             Czone is pleased to provide this forum for you to share your opinions on products. While we appreciate your time and comments, we limit customer participation to one<br>
             review per product and reserve the right to remove reviews that include any of the following: Objectionable material: • Obscene or distasteful content • Profanity or spiteful<br>
             remarks • Promotion of illegal or immoral conduct Promotional content: • Advertisements, promotional material or repeated posts that make the same point excessively • <br>
             Sentiments by or on behalf of a person or company with a financial interest in the product or a directly competing product (including reviews by publishers, manufacturers, or<br>
             third-party merchants selling the product) • Reviews those are written for any form of compensation other than a free copy of the product. This includes reviews that are a part<br>
             of a paid publicity package • Solicitations for helpful votes Inappropriate content: • Other people's material (this includes excessive quoting) • Phone numbers, postal mailing<br>
             addresses, and URLs external to czone.com.pk • Comments on other reviews visible on the page (because page visibility is subject to change without notice)
